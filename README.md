# H A N G

## Overview
* This app allows friends to create profiles and link up to other friends, perhaps by way of facebook or twitter / gmail etc.

* It allows those friends to notate their schedule (regular work hours, regular commitments) and to create events / invite other friends to hang out with them. If the "invite" to hangout or do something together falls in the regular work hours of that person, the app throws up an error. if it does throw up the error - you should have the option to send the invite anyways (in the case that your friend decides he wants to pick your event over his existing obligation)


## Requirements and rough outline
* it also allows you to see what friends are available currently, and when they might be available in the future to hang out.

* it should integrate with google calendar, or other calendars

* it should also allow the person to accept or deny requests to hang out

with each request to hang out, the user should be able to enter in a message that answers the question "what will you be doing in this hangout?" will it be netflix and chill? dinner and a movie? just chilling on the porch? all these things.


* it should either have an in-built messaging system, or be able to send and receive texts directly from the app

* if not this - it should give you the phone number / other contact method if the other person has responded and say "here's their number, call/text your friend!"

* creating events should also throw up a list of people who are and aren't available, potentially in a very well visualized/ easy to understand way. perhaps give you a radio list of potential friends who are free at that time that you can invite and which are busy at that time

* UI should be very simple and minimal

* the app should also allow you to set your normal schedule there and build a list of activities you like to do. e.g. I like to hang and play video games, other friends who also like video games should see this when they join the app with a pop-up like "hey, casey likes a bunch of stuff you like, maybe you two should hang?

# Additional Features:

* a feature where it tells you if you've accepted a hang-invite with people you don't know

* a feature that tells you who you hang with the most, the least, etc

* the app should also allow you to set weights on certain obligations - like work for example no one can skip out on - the app should tell you that you're about to try and get that person to hang out with you during their work hours. but let's say your friend has a "date" on their schedule that they don't really want to go to but it's on their schedule, you should be able to offer them an invite in that same time slot with no guilt.

* same weights can be applied to activities / things to do as well

* set private hangs and public hangs. if you're on a date it might be private, if you're hosting a party, might be public

* determine if the hang will cost money
